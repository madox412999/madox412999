# 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel (a.k.a. madox412999)

I'm a beginner developer exploring **Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML & CSS**.  
I might not know everything yet — but I learn fast, build with passion, and always give 100%.

This profile is a growing collection of my projects and skills as I learn and build real-world apps.  
Thanks for checking it out!
